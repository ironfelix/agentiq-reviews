## Battle Cards for Sales

### vs Sierra

**When prospect says:** "We're looking at Sierra"

**Response:**
> "Sierra is excellent for enterprises like Sonos and Casper who need custom solutions
> and have 6-12 months for implementation. However, if you're a DTC brand looking to:
> - Get started in days, not months
> - Pay $1-2k/month instead of $200k/year
> - Work with e-commerce experts, not generalists
> ...then we're purpose-built for you."

**Key points:**
- ✅ They're enterprise, we're DTC-focused
- ✅ They take months, we take days

- ✅ We know e-commerce deeply

### vs Intercom

### vs Zendesk

**When prospect says:** "We're on Zendesk"

> - $115-169/agent when you have 20 agents = $2,300-3,380/mo
> - Enterprise features (80+ languages) you might not use
> - Generic automation vs e-commerce-specific
