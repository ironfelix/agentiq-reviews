# Product Screens & UX Research: AI Customer Service Platforms

## Purpose

Identify the essential screens/pages that a quality AI customer service product needs, based on analysis of Sierra.ai and competitors. Focus on what's ESSENTIAL for a minimal, clean product targeting marketplace sellers (WB/Ozon).

---

## 1. Sierra.ai — Product Structure

### Product Philosophy
Sierra takes a "three pillars" approach: **Configure > Deploy > Optimize**. The product is enterprise-grade but the interface philosophy is clean and focused. Agent Studio is the central hub — no clutter, no feature-stuffing.

### Core Product Pages (from sierra.ai/product)

| # | Product Area | Description | Key Screens |
|---|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Agent Studio** | No-code agent builder | Journeys editor, Knowledge manager, Brand settings, Integration library |
| 2 | **Agent SDK** | Developer tools | Code editor, Goals/guardrails config |
| 3 | **Insights** | Analytics & optimization | Metrics dashboard, Explorer (conversational analytics), Automated tagging |
| 4 | **Voice** | Phone channel | Call handling config |
| 5 | **Live Assist** | Human agent copilot | Real-time guidance, auto-drafted responses |
| 6 | **Trust** | Security & compliance | Data policies, access controls |

### Agent Studio 2.0 — Key Screens

**1. Journeys (workflow builder)**

- Define agent instructions for specific flows
- Reference external tools and dynamic data
- Built-in testing and simulations

**2. Knowledge Management**
- Edit help center articles, FAQs, policies
- Upload/sync knowledge sources (JSON, help center URLs)
- "Knowledge Gaps" — AI auto-detects missing info
- Retrieval audits — trace which knowledge was used

**3. Branding & Controls**
- Agent name, welcome message
- Logo, colors (visual branding)
- Voice and tone settings
- Topic/keyword filters and monitors

**4. Content & Settings**
- Dynamic content updates (promotions, service changes)
- Personalized offers management
- Multimodal content (images, videos)

**5. Simulations (Testing)**
- AI-powered conversation simulation
- Regression test suites
- Voice simulation testing
- Performance evaluation against defined outcomes

**6. Workspaces (Collaboration)**
- GitHub-like branching for agent configs
- Private editing spaces
- Version control with QA > staging > production pipeline
- Audit trail and rollback

### Insights 2.0 — Analytics Screens

**1. Key Metrics Dashboard**
- CSAT (auto-calculated, no surveys needed)
- Resolution rate
- Conversation volume
- Transfer/escalation rate
- Topic trends
- Resolution counts

**2. Explorer**
- "ChatGPT-style Deep Research for conversations"
- Natural language queries over conversation data
- Pattern detection across interactions
- Follow-up investigation capability

**3. Expert Answers**
- Auto-generates knowledge articles from insights
- Edit, approve, publish workflow
- Closes the loop: insight > article > improved agent

**4. Automated Tagging**
- Auto-categorize conversations
- Identify customer interests and themes

**5. Experimentation**

### Sierra Pricing Model
- Outcome-based: pay only for successful resolutions

### Key Takeaway from Sierra
Sierra's genius is the **Configure > Deploy > Optimize** loop. But it's enterprise-heavy. For a marketplace seller product, we need the ESSENCE of this but 10x simpler.

## 8. Russian Marketplace Seller Tools (WB/Ozon)

### Existing Tools for Review Management

| Service | Price | Key Features | Limitations |
|---------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Otveto.ru** | from 1.57 RUB/msg | AI auto-replies, 3 modes (manual/semi/auto), analysis of 1000 reviews in seconds, Telegram bot, browser extension, cross-platform chats | No quality analysis of existing replies, no analytics dashboard |
| **Otvechumba** | 1,400-7,000 RUB/mo | Smart auto-replies, negative review alerts, auto-delegation, category management, response speed reports, flexible templates | WB + Ozon only, no Yandex Market |
| **MP Manager** | varies | AI-generated replies, multi-platform, sales analytics | More focused on analytics than communication |
| **Spix** | varies | 9 marketplaces, AI replies, review analytics | Broad but shallow per platform |
| **OzonReviewerBot** | varies | Automated review processing, 24/7 auto-replies | Ozon-focused |
| **APIMonster** | varies | Auto-replies for Ozon and WB | Basic functionality |

### Key Gaps in Existing Russian Tools
1. **No quality analysis** of seller's existing replies (harmful/risky/acceptable/good)
2. **No communication ROI** — no link between reply quality and sales/ratings
3. **No AI coaching** — just auto-generation, no feedback on what's wrong
4. **No unified dashboard** for reviews + chats + questions across platforms
5. **No SLA tracking** for response times
6. **No team management** — most are single-user tools
7. **No analytics beyond basics** — no intent detection, sentiment tracking, trend analysis

### Market Context
- Cards with active review management show **15-25% sales increase** (2025 data)
- Platforms algorithmically boost sellers who respond actively
- **+20% conversion** when responding within 1 hour (official WB statistic)

## 10. Recommended Screen Architecture (Minimal, Sierra-style)

### Navigation Structure (sidebar)

```
[AgentIQ Logo]

Dashboard          <- Home/overview
Chat Center        <- Unified inbox (main workspace)
Analytics          <- Reports & quality scores
  - Overview
  - Response Quality
  - Speed & SLA
Products           <- Product cards + knowledge
Settings           <- Configuration

  - Brand           <- Name, logo, welcome message
  - Team            <- Users (future)
  - Notifications   <- Alerts config
```

### Onboarding (separate flow, shown on first login)

```
Step 1: Welcome + value prop
Step 2: Connect marketplace (enter WB/Ozon API token)
Step 3: Import products (auto-fetch from API)
Step 4: Configure AI tone & rules (quick presets)
Step 5: Test auto-reply on sample review
Step 6: Go live!
```

### Design Principles (learned from Sierra)

1. **Progressive disclosure** — Start simple, reveal complexity as needed
2. **Single workspace focus** — Chat Center is where sellers spend 80% of time
3. **AI-first, not AI-optional** — Every screen has AI augmentation
4. **Metrics that matter** — Revenue impact > vanity metrics
5. **No-code configuration** — Everything configurable without technical knowledge
6. **Mobile-ready** — Sellers check on phone constantly
7. **Fast time-to-value** — Working auto-replies within 10 minutes of signup
